<p  style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> One of my favorite series of paintings at the National Gallery was the Voyage of Life series by Thomas Cole. It showcased 4 paintings going through different stages of a person's life. The names of the paintings were Childhood, Youth,  Adulthood, and Old Age. 
My favorite painting of the series was Old Age. I liked this painting the most because it was nostalgic and happy at the same time. It showed an old man reaching towards an angel from his boat. I thought that showed that the person was happy with their life/voyage, but ready
to move on at the same time. The whole series was also interesting to me because it showed how a person's perspective will change with age. </p>



<h2  style="font-size: 200%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> Albert Bierstadt: The Last of the Buffalo </h2>
<head> <img src="the last of the buffalo.jpg" width="500px" height="240px"> </head>
<p style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> This was another one of my favorite paintings. I think that it is very detailed, and also a little bit creepy. If you look closely, you can see dead buffalo, horses, and people. I still liked the painting because of the prairie landscape, and all of the action in the painting. </p>



<h3 style="font-size: 200%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;">  Pierre-Auguste Renoir: Young Spanish Woman with a Guitar </h3>
<head> <img src="guitar painting.jpg" width="500px" height="240px"> </head>
<p  style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> This was also another one of my favorite paintings. It is very simple, but it's also abstract and dark. I like the hat that the woman is wearing, and I also like how the guitar was painted. Another thing I like is how happy the woman seems in the painting. </p>



<h4  style="font-size: 200%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> Vincent Van Gogh: Roses </h4>
<head> <img src="Roses.jpg" width="500px" height="240px"> </head>
<p  style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> I liked this painting for multiple reasons. I think it was very simple, but also detailed and abstract at the same time. I liked how the flowers were all one color, and they also complemented the vase that they were in. Another thing I liked were the swirls in the painting itself. </p>



<h5  style="font-size: 200%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> Eugene Delacroix: Tiger Growling at a Snake </h5>
<head> <img src="tiger v snake.jpg" width="500px" height="240px"> </head>
<p  style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Papyrus; text-align: center;"> I liked this painting , but it was not one of my all-time favorites. The tiger was my favorite part of this painting because it was so colorful. I also like how the snake curled around the tree. The most interesting part of this piece for me was the fact that a tiger and snake were actually 
fighting each other. </p>
